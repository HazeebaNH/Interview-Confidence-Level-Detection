# Interview_confidence
It is a project to detect the confidence level of candidates in an interview.
Used Keras to load a pre-trained deep learning model for real-time image classification using a webcam. OpenCV is employed to capture video frames from the webcam, resize them, and display the processed frames in real-time.
NumPy facilitated numerical operations and array handling, crucial for preprocessing webcam frames before feeding them into the deep learning model.
